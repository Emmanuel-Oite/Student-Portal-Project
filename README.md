# Student Directory Web Application

The Student Directory Web Application is a simple web-based tool for managing student information, course lists, and grades. It allows you to view and edit student data, including student names, ages, majors, courses, and grades.

## Features

- View a list of students with their details, courses, and grades.
- Edit a student's information, including their name, age, and major.
- Add new students to the directory with their details.
- Delete students from the directory.
- Update grades for individual courses.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. You will see a list of students with their information, including courses and grades.

3. To edit a student's information, click the "Edit" button on the student card. You can change the name, age, and major.

4. To add a new student, click the "Add Student" button at the top of the page. You will be prompted to enter the new student's name, age, and major. The student will be added to the directory with an empty course list.

5. To delete a student, click the "Delete" button on the student card. The student and their information will be removed from the directory.

6. To update a student's grade for a specific course, click the "Update Grade" button next to the course name. You will be prompted to enter the new grade for that course.

## Data Storage

The student data is stored in a separate JSON file named `students.json`. When you make changes to the student directory, the application will save the updated data back to this JSON file.
